INTRODUCTION

SQL Code Assistant plugin for IntelliJ IDEA provides extended editing capability
for SQL and PL/SQL code of the Oracle database.

The database objects are always at your fingertips no matter where they came from - the database

the objects, edit and execute SQL statements, navigate over the code, search for usages in
