Plugin build procedure:

1. To build the plugin some jars aer needed from the Intellij IDEA lib area.
Copy the following jars to the SQL-Code-Assistant-/sqlassistant-plugin11/idea-11-lib directory (create the dir if it does not exist):

 annotations.jar
 extensions.jar
 idea.jar
 javac2.jar
 openapi.jar
 picocontainer.jar
 trove4j.jar
 util.jar

Also, Oracle JDBC driver (ojdbc5.jar) is needed to build the plugin.
The driver can be downloaded free of charge from Oracle Technet.

Save downloaded ojdbc5.jar file in the SQL-Code-Assistant-/shared/lib/ folder.

2. Run "generate_plsql_parser" ANT task to generate plsql parser using antlr grammar from grammars directory.

3. "generate_system_function_mapping" ANT task generates a marshaller to convert XML definition of Oracle's functions to
java objects.

4. "build_plugin" compiles code and builds the sql-assistant-${plugin.ver}.jar jar file.

IMPORTANT! before running of the "build_plugin" ANT task make sure you have run "Make Project" from IDEA IDE
and project has been built successfully. The "build_pligin" task uses some classes generated by IDEA on the
compilation phase.

5. Run the target task "bundle_plugin" to have all required jars collected to the bundle ready for deployment.
